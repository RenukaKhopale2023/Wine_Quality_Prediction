# Red Wine Quality Prediction
## Project Overview
The "Red Wine Quality Prediction" project is a machine learning project that aims to predict the quality of red wines based on various chemical properties and characteristics. This project is designed to demonstrate the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to the field of wine quality assessment.

It includes a collection of red wine samples with associated attributes and quality ratings. The dataset contains information on chemical properties like acidity levels, pH, alcohol content, and more.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the various stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
scripts: This directory may contain any Python scripts used for data processing or model training if applicable.

Getting Started
## Prerequisites
## To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn (for data visualization)
## Model Selection
For this project, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The final model Random forest was selected based on its performance metrics, including mean squared error and R-squared.

## Results
The project achieved around 92 % as the evaluation metrics, indicating the model's ability to predict red wine quality effectively.

## Future Improvements
In the future, we can explore additional techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or advanced machine learning algorithms to further improve prediction accuracy.
